**Blocky Bugs** is a puzzle game I made for LowRezJam 2021. That's all. 

### [Play here](https://jani-nykanen.itch.io/blocky-bugs)

------

## Building

Type `make js` to build the project. Then start a server in the root, so you can play the game on `localhost`.

## License

I'll think of this later. You can do whatever you want with the code, although I recommend giving a credit, but that is not necessary. Assets (art & audio) are currently not for free use, because why would you want to use them anyway, they aren't that great!
